# Iron Software programming test (Old Phone Pad)

The goal of the program is to parse a string made up of characters representing button presses on an old Nokia-style
phone. The parser converts the input into the message that would result from the button presses.

A commandline program is provided, as well as unit tests for the program code.

# Building

A Solution file for Visual Studio 2022 is provided. Open the `iron.sln` solution and select `Build Solution`.

## Dependencies

* C++17
* C++ Standard Library

# Running tests

Microsoft's CppUnitTestFramework is used. Select `Test/Run All Tests` from the IDE menu to execute them.

# Libraries

A static library is generated by the `parserphonepad` project that may be used in other projects in the usual way.

# Running the commandline program

The project `iron` builds the commandline program, which is generated in the `build` folder below the project directory. 
Run the resulting `iron.exe` program with no parameters for usage instructions.
